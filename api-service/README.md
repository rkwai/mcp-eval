# API Service

Container for the domain logic and REST API facade that expose underlying capabilities to external callers. Build Express/TypeScript (or preferred stack) handlers, business rules, and integration clients here.

## Suggested structure
- `src/` – Core domain modules, controllers, data access, and wiring.
- `tests/` – Unit and integration tests specific to the API layer.
- `config/` – Environment-specific settings, secrets templates, and deployment manifests.
