## Channels & Communities
Primary activity in the OpenAI Community forum `#tooling`, LangChain Slack `#mcp`, and the "Agentic Systems" Discord (12k members, ~1.3k weekly active). GitHub stars on comparable repos (e.g., `openai/mcp` +42% since December). Conference demand: dedicated MCP workshop slots at AI Dev Summit (June 2024) sold out in 3 days.

## Trend & Forecast Notes
- Growth rate / seasonality: Search and community engagement spiked after MCP launch announcements at DevDay 2023; expect seasonal dip in late summer but 2.1× YoY demand projected.
- Emerging competitors or substitutes: LangGraph + Guardrails bundles, Anthropic ToolUse SDK, bespoke consulting packages; differentiator for this template is eval rigor and REST retrofits.

## Retrieval Process
- Monthly: Export keyword volume from Keyword Planner and update HubSpot briefing count.
- Quarterly: Sample 50 community threads for qualitative insights; refresh job posting counts via saved LinkedIn query.
- Continuous: Track GitHub stars and Discord membership via public APIs; log outreach inquiries in CRM.
