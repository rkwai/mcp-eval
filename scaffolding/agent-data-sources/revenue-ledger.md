# Revenue Ledger

## Description
Commercial packaging for the MCP Evaluation Template spans a free self-serve path, a guided "done-with-you" engagement, and a premium "done-for-you" delivery for teams that want turnkey MCP server deployment and eval coverage.

## Revenue Models
| Model Type | Description | Status | Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Self-serve | Open-source repo, docs, and sample evals; monetises via upsell into guided services | Active | $0 price; track activation → upsell funnel |
| Done-with-you | Hands-on coaching from MCP experts, helping internal engineers implement and harden their server over weekly sprints | Active | $1,200 per month until project completion (avg 3–4 months) |
| Done-for-you | End-to-end implementation, evaluation automation, and handoff, scoped per client complexity | Active | Project fees start at $10k and scale to $20k+ for multi-API rollouts |

## Key Inputs
- Pricing tiers: Self-serve (free), Done-with-you ($1.2k/month), Done-for-you ($10k–$20k+ fixed bid).
- Cost structure: Advisory staff time $150/hr blended; typical done-with-you engagement consumes 12 hrs/month; done-for-you projects staffed with 2 engineers + 1 PM for 6 weeks (~180 hrs).
- Margin targets: 70% gross margin on done-with-you (net of advisor hours); 55–60% margin on done-for-you after delivery contingencies; self-serve CAC <$120 per converted upsell.

## Validation Notes
Track funnel conversion from self-serve clones to paid engagements via HubSpot lifecycle dashboards. Reconcile invoicing in Stripe with time-tracking entries monthly. Finance verifies revenue recognition (ASC 606) based on milestones for fixed-fee projects.
