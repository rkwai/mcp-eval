# Market Opportunity Analysis

## Summary
- Target customers actively seeking a solution: Platform and AI operations teams at mid-market SaaS companies (ARR $20M–$250M) plus enterprise innovation labs modernising tool-calling stacks.
- Top problems they are trying to solve (include real examples): Wrapping mature REST APIs in MCP to avoid rewrites, validating tool-call accuracy before rolling agents into production, and demonstrating evaluation evidence to leadership. Example: a fintech platform needs golden tool-call transcripts to satisfy compliance before enabling agent workflows for customer support.
- Strategic fit: Leverages existing REST investments while differentiating with rigorous evals; aligns with our expertise in MCP orchestration and developer tooling.

## Demand Signals (Proof of Demand)
| Signal Type | Evidence | Volume / Frequency | Source | Notes |
|-------------|----------|--------------------|--------|-------|
| Search queries | Queries such as "model context protocol", "mcp server", "tool calling evaluation" | 18.4k avg monthly (Jan–Mar 2024) | Google Keyword Planner (est.) | 47% QoQ growth since Q4 2023
| Job postings / RFPs | Roles mentioning "tool calling" and "MCP" requirements | 64 active listings in Q1 2024 | LinkedIn Talent Insights | Concentrated in AI platform teams
| Community discussions | Threads/workshops requesting MCP evaluation templates | 126 discussions in Q1 2024 | OpenAI Community & MCP Discord | 71% positive sentiment sample
| Budget allocations | Average spend earmarked for agent evaluation tooling | $42k per team for FY2024 | Customer interviews (n=18) | Tied to reliability OKRs and launch gates
| Vendor briefings | Prospects asking for MCP eval best practices | 9 briefings (Jan–Mar 2024) | HubSpot report | Mix of Fortune 500 and digital-native clients

## Segments & Personas
| Segment | Persona | Jobs-to-be-done | Channels where demand appears |
|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Mid-market SaaS | Platform Lead | Ship MCP-compliant interface over existing API catalogue, reduce integration drift | OpenAI Community, LangChain Slack, AI Dev Summit
| Enterprise innovation lab | Agent Reliability PM | Validate pilot agents meet governance requirements before production launch | "Agentic Systems" Discord, vendor briefings, internal AI councils
| Consultancies | Solutions Architect | Deliver turnkey MCP deployments for clients with proof of evaluation rigor | Partner portals, LinkedIn groups, direct outreach

## Opportunity Hypotheses
1. Hypothesis: Teams with REST-heavy estates will adopt an eval-driven MCP template to accelerate agent pilots by 4–6 weeks.
   - Demand evidence: High search volume for MCP server guidance and repeated requests for evaluation frameworks.
   - Validation plan: Run 3 design partner engagements tracking time-to-first passing eval suite vs. prior baseline; capture qualitative satisfaction interviews.
2. Hypothesis: Providing golden eval transcripts and revenue-led packaging increases conversion from free self-serve to paid done-with-you contracts by 25%.
   - Demand evidence: $42k average budget allocation and 9 inbound vendor briefings seeking hands-on guidance.
   - Validation plan: Instrument funnel in CRM; A/B test outreach sequences bundling eval assets against control.

## Competition & Alternatives
- Existing solutions users turn to: LangGraph + Guardrails bundles, Anthropic ToolUse SDK best practices, bespoke consulting playbooks.
- Gaps in current offerings: Lack of REST-focused templates, limited tooling for asserting tool-call payloads, and sparse documentation on evaluation cadences.

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Data Source | Owner |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Self-serve → done-with-you conversion rate | 12% (est. from early adopters) | 25% by Q4 2024 | HubSpot lifecycle funnel | Growth Lead
| Eval suite adoption (unique orgs running golden scenarios) | 0 (launch state) | 35 orgs by Q3 2024 | `mcp-server/evals/logs/` aggregation | Eval Analytics Lead
| Time-to-green for new tool integration | 4 weeks (average manual validation) | 10 days with template | Customer interviews + onboarding surveys | Product PM
